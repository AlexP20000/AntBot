# M²APix on-board processing

The python code "MapixResult.py" applies cross-correlation method to M²APix data to determine the average speed during the acquisition. This code assumes the average speed of the robot is constant (approx. 8.5cm/s). If reused, please be aware of the speed margins set in the code.
