# AntBot's 3D Parts

These are the 3D parts required to reproduce the frame of our hexapod robot AntBot. For our study, AntBot's parts have been printed with PLA filament. The roll-actuated head of the robot is not provided for the moment. The robot's firmware, to be uploaded in the Arduino-like OpenCM9.04C, will be added soon. Feel free to contact me for any information.

* In order to build one leg, you will need the following files: 1x "AntBot's Leg.stl", 2x "ServoFixation.stl", and 2x brackets available at https://www.trossenrobotics.com/bioloid-metal-f2-bracket for the metal ones, or at https://www.trossenrobotics.com/bioloid-frame-f2 if you prefer the plastic ones (refer to "Leg.png").

* All the legs must be fixed between two parts ("Frame.stl", as shown in "AntBot's Frame.jpg").  

* The battery can be placed within its support ("BatterySupport.stl"). Be careful, this was created for the following batteries: Gens Ace 3S1P 5300mAh (Li-Po).
